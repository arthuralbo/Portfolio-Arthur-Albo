# Arthur Albo | Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my project hub. I am a Data Science student at Concordia University, focused on the intersection of **Mathematical Modeling**, **Statistical Validation**, and **Automated Data Engineering**. 

This portfolio highlights my ability to build end-to-end solutions—from raw data intake to interactive analysis.

## 🛠 Technical Toolkit

* **Programming:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy), SQL, TypeScript
* **Web & Visualization:** Streamlit, Plotly, Dash
* **Engineering:** Google Apps Script, Vercel, Git, API Integration
* **Methodology:** Hypothesis Testing, Predictive Modeling, Data Integrity Gatekeeping

## 🚀 Key Projects

### [CleanCode Data Engine]
**Mathematical Gatekeeper for Raw Data**
* **Problem:** "Dirty" data (type mismatches, mixed date formats, outliers) frequently breaks downstream models.
* **Solution:** Built a non-destructive automation tool that enforces strict type-checking and structural cleaning. 
* **Key Feature:** Implements a "strict validation phase" that identifies and flags corrupted cells by row and column before processing begins.
* *Built with: Google Apps Script, JavaScript*

### [Large-Scale Usage Analysis](https://bixi-patterns.streamlit.app/)
**Pattern Recognition in Geospatial Datasets**
* **Problem:** High-volume operational data often hides latent behavioral patterns and bottlenecks.
* **Solution:** Conducted a deep-dive exploratory analysis into thousands of trip records to uncover seasonal trends and geographic dependencies.
* **Insight:** Transformed raw logs into a visual narrative of urban movement using statistical clustering and time-series decomposition.
* *Built with: Python, Streamlit, Plotly*

### [Personal AI-Driven Portal](https://portfolio-arthur-albo.vercel.app/)
**Full-Stack Portfolio Deployment**
* **Purpose:** An interactive gateway to explore my technical history and projects.
* **Technical Focus:** Deployed a React-based application using a modern Vite workflow on Vercel, integrating generative AI for a dynamic user experience.
* *Built with: React 19, Vite, Gemini API, Tailwind CSS*

## 📈 My Approach

I believe that every robust model starts with rigorous **Data Stewardship**. My workflow prioritizes:
1.  **Integrity Checks:** Validating data types and distributions before analysis.
2.  **Statistical Clarity:** Using inference and modeling to move beyond simple observations to root-cause insights.
3.  **Modular Engineering:** Building tools that are reusable and easy for other stakeholders to adopt.
